# CustomerInterface
Project for OOP

This is a Java program that handles Customer Interaction based around a shopping application. This is the original first draft
of the project that I turned in for grading. This was the result of a few days of thinking about the design of the project.
I will include a list of demands for the project. I couldn't think of a logical way to include inheritance or polymorphism.
Perhaps I could've included such practices but it would be outside of vision I created in my mind.

I came to the conclusion that I would have a total of three classes. One for the Customer that represents all of the attributes
a Customer could need and methods that are needed to handle anything referring to the Customer.
