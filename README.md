# CustomerInterface
Project for OOP

This is a Java program that handles Customer Interaction based around a shopping application. This is the original first draft
of the project that I turned in for grading. This was the result of a few days of thinking about the design of the project.
I will include a list of demands for the project. I couldn't think of a logical way to include inheritance or polymorphism.
Perhaps I could've included such practices but it would be outside of vision I created in my mind.

I came to the conclusion that I would have a total of three classes. One for the Customer that represents all of the attributes
a Customer could need and methods that are needed to handle anything referring to the Customer. CartContents that functions as
a "tripple" I believe to store item, quantity and price. ShoppingCart that handles loading/unloading and purchasing cart
contents.

The bulk of the grade did not seem to be weighted too much on whether this initial program works so I have not tested most of
it. The majority of it was coded with only concern for not tripping the intelliJ flags. I ran into a few problems concerning
the reading and writing to files as I'm not too experienced with this. I scoured the internet for solutions to my problems and
used A.I. when I was confused about the logic I had found or when I would get lost in my own logic. I feel A.I. does a decent
job of finding logic problems in code which is different than avoiding implementing its own logical errors.
